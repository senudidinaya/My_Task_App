# My Tasks App 📝

**A lightweight and intuitive Android task manager built with Kotlin and SQLite. 🚀**

## Overview

**My Tasks App** is a simple yet effective Android application designed to help you keep track of your daily to-dos. ✅ Developed entirely in **Kotlin** using **Android Studio**, this app leverages a local **SQLite** database 🗄️ for efficient and persistent storage of your tasks directly on your device.

I built this project to gain a solid understanding and practical experience with fundamental Android development concepts, particularly focusing on:
* Building a clean and responsive user interface with Jetpack Compose (if applicable, otherwise mention XML/Views). ✨
* Implementing local data persistence using SQLite. 💾
* Performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. ➕📖✍️🗑️

## Features

* **Add New Tasks:** Easily create new tasks with a title and a detailed description. ✍️
* **View All Tasks:** See an organized list of all your pending tasks. 📋
* **Edit Existing Tasks:** Modify the title or description of any task. ✏️
* **Delete Tasks:** Remove completed or unwanted tasks with a tap. 🗑️
* **Local Storage:** All your tasks are stored securely on your device using SQLite. 🔒
